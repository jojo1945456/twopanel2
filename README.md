# Statistical Analysis using R Visualization



The PowerPoint file was updated with the link to my GitHub Repository. Please use Final\_Project\_updated.



My project uses R visualizations to analyze the Salary Prediction dataset downloaded from Kaggle. 



The Project Files include

* A shiny app named app with two interactive panels that provide visualizations on the dataset variables. 
* R studio code named Final\_Project\_main with all the visualizations that I did before coding the shiny app.
* A PowerPoint presentation file name Final\_Project
* A CSV file of the Salary Prediction dataset named SalaryData that was used for the project.
